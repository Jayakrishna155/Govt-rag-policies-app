Such disputes may arise out of any real or perceived\nthreat to the advantage that management or labour sees as its right. Since Industrial\nRelations are a vital part of the economic system, even a temporary setback in the\nharmonious co-existence of these two factors of production can affect the whole system\nnegatively. In fact, industrial conflict affects the community as a whole and prevention of\nsuch conflicts is and would be a high priority for the Labour Department. For this purpose, it\nwould re-orient its approach and become a facilitator in the proper implementation of\nlabour laws and labour welfare measures by disseminating information and assisting in\ncompliance.
